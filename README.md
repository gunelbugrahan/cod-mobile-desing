<h1>I learn HTML CSS BOOTSTRAP and JavaScript</h1>
<br>
<p>HTML CSS BOOTSTRAP and JavaScript is a project that I created to understand the logic of where and how it is used to develop,
some JS codes also include a few things that I removed in the project, but when I look at it, I can understand what is what, they are still there because I don't want to remove them. </p>
